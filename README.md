# jiraTicketComplexity


This is a project that will categorize relative ticket complexity of Jira tickets.

It will use JQL to draw tickets from Jira ticket database, strip them down to thier TF-IDF bones, and use some sort of modeling to categorize them as "very complicated" "mildly complicated" and "uncomplicated"
